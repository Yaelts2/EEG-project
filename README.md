# EEG-Based Phoneme Classification Using Machine Learning
## Project Overview
This project investigates whether individual phonemes can be decoded from EEG signals recorded during a passive listening task. We developed a machine learning pipeline to classify 11 different phonemes, including both vowels and consonants, directly from brain activity.

The core goal of this project is to determine if short, time-locked EEG segments contain sufficient information for a supervised classifier to predict the heard phoneme above chance level. Our findings show that while fine-grained classification is challenging, there are clear and discernible differences between broader phonetic categories, particularly between vowels and consonants.

### Phonemes Classified
The models were trained to classify the following 11 phonemes:

Consonants: /b/, /d/, /p/, /s/, /t/, /z/

Vowels: /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/, /o/
